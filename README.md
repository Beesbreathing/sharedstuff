- This is just a random essay I felt like writing.
- [Human Nature](https://www.marxisthumanistinitiative.org/philosophy-organization/marxs-human-nature-distinguishing-essence-from-essentialism.html)
- The Pope, Jesus, Super-Genius-Billionaires, God, etc.. will save us. No

- We will save ourselves. For perspective on this consider the root of the problem.

- Through the development of life and natural selection, we've inherited a great many arbitrary and intermediate needs, chief of all these to continue living. In addition to this we have other arbitrary and intermediate social needs. All this to say, The main problem humanity has to solve, is the needs we have inherited arbitrarily through the natural and random development of life. 

- The goal of life then is for life to liberate itself from the chains it's birthed in. Humanity is over many primary hurtles of this path, but in the way have erected more intermediate goals as a result of class rule and class struggle. Beurocracy and Warfare, profits and growth for profits and growths sake. Mean we must sustain, replace, and destroy many systems on the way toward freeing ourselves from the primary chains of natural-needs.

- There are two ways to liberate ourselves from the arbitrary needs of life. Transhumanism and Extinction. Extinction would technically be easiest, and fastest. Though the fesibility of self-extinction is directly fought against by the need to continue living, so, is there a way to kill off humanity without humanity ceasing to continue to live?

- Transhumanism.
