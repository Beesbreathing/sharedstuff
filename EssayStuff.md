### Risk, and the right of capitalists to exploit the workers.

- *"The capitalist deserves to exploit surplus value since they bear the risk of opening, maintaining, and improving the business. They bear the cost of starting it and keeping it open. They bear the responsibility for whether the firm fails or succeeds, the workers dont. The value created by the workplace may be created from workers labour, but it is the workplace the capitalist is responsible for which was required to make the surplus value that the capitalist exploits as remuneration for this responsibility."*
  
  - As in, Society ought to pay them via allowing the exploitation of their workers surplus value. In exchange for taking a risk and operating a business.

- That is the usual Pro-Exploitation argument. Now, the first response a socialist would give here is that it's a moot point, Gambling shouldnt be a fundamental part of the economy.
  
  - If you could have a planned economy, with a pro-active enough planning institution, then you'd have a means of absorbing all risks in the economy, with the economy as a whole, instead of dividing them amongst the capitalists. Such a thing would mitigate the risk and instability brunted here by the capitalists.
  
  - Then the question would be, in simplistic words "how many firms will fail, and what should we prepare with to respond to their failure." Which is a much easier question to answer for a planning institution, than the question capitalists must answer "will my firm fail, which firms relavent to me will fail, and what can I do to prevent it." As that question simply has far more things to worry about.
  
  - A planned economy would mitigate risk, instead of rewarding it. The risk-managing jobs capitalists fulfill are not desired.
  
  - The real conversation to be having is about the efficacy, specifics, and historical examples of planned economies. As well as stuff like whether planned economies would need to engage in exploitation before full automation was reached, and what that should strive to accomplish on the road there.
  
  - Thats A very different conversation than this one on the rights of capitalist to exploit. The kind of conversation socialists have with eachother, critiquing the present and dreaming of the future, instead of *conserving* the past.

- Though, if it seems that the question of exploiting workers is still a hot ticket that must be discussed, lets get into that too. (this parts WIP)
