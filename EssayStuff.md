### Humanism, Transhumanism, and Communism

- The Pope, Jesus, Super-Genius-Billionaires, God, etc.. will not save us.

- We will save ourselves. For perspective on this, consider the root of the problem.

- Through the development of life and natural selection, we've inherited a great many arbitrary needs, along with their intermediate needs, chief of all these is to continue living, as that ones required for us to find ourselves where we do, required for life to get this far, for us anyways.

- In addition to this we have other arbitrary and intermediate social needs. All this to say, The main problem humanity has to solve, is the needs we have inherited arbitrarily through the natural and random development of life. 

- The goal of life then is for life to liberate itself from the chains it's birthed in. Humanity is over many primary hurtles of this path, but in the way have erected more intermediate goals as a result of class rule and class struggle. Bureaucracy and Warfare, profits and growth for profits and growths sake. Mean we must sustain, replace, and destroy many systems on the way toward freeing ourselves from the primary chains of natural-needs.

- There are two ways to liberate ourselves from the arbitrary needs of life. The first is Extinction. Extinction would technically be easiest, and fastest. Though the fesibility of self-extinction is directly fought against by the need to continue living, so, is there a way to liberate humanity without ceasing to live?

- Transhumanism and Communism, saving ourselves.
  
  - So first and foremost, transhumanism's popularization cant be ignored, its popularization is essentially as a capitalist religion, as ways that Capital and the technology companies specifically have speerheaded, as a religion with technology billionaire genius trailblazers as saviors, and this new human technology evolution revolution thing as our salvation. An ideology held by libertarians who dream of being Nietzschean Ubermenschen. An individualistic ideology which peddles the same capitalist dribble that there is some inherent issue to solve with people before they're valuable in society. So, lets talk here of a transhuman that's aware of this, a transhumanism spawned of the same roots, but without the ideas of it's neoliberal popularizers. A more human transhumanism.

### Do capitalists deserve to exploit workers?

- *"The capitalist deserves to exploit surplus value since they bear the risk of opening, maintaining, and improving the business. They bear the cost of starting it and keeping it open. They bear the responsibility for whether the firm fails or succeeds, the workers dont. The value created by the workplace may be created from workers labour, but it is the workplace the capitalist is responsible for which was required to make the surplus value that the capitalist exploits as remuneration for this responsibility." or "the capitalist made an investment and this is how they should get their return."*
  
  - As in, Society ought to pay capitalists via allowing the exploitation of their workers surplus value, In exchange for taking a risk and operating a business. 

- That is the usual Pro-Exploitation argument. Now, the first response a socialist would probably give here is that it's a moot point, Gambling shouldnt be a fundamental part of the economy. 
  
  - If you could have a planned economy, with a proactive enough planning institution or computer system, then you'd have a means of absorbing all risks in the economy, with the economy as a whole, instead of dividing them amongst the capitalists. Such a thing would mitigate the risk and instability said to be brunted here by the capitalists.
  
  - Then the question would be, in simplistic words "how many firms will fail, and what should we prepare with to respond to their failure." Which is a much easier question to answer for a planning institution, than the question capitalists must answer "will my firm fail, which firms relavent to me will fail, and what can I do to prevent it." As that question simply has far more things to worry about. 
  
  - Planned economies mitigate risk, instead of rewarding it. The risk-managing jobs capitalists fulfill are not desired to exist.
  
  - The real conversation to be having is about things like whether planned economies would need to engage in exploitation before full automation was reached, whether non-aggregate markets can be planned effectly or not, what the road to the abolition of exploitation really looks like, Etc.. As in the efficacies, shortcomings, specifics, and historical examples of planned economies. 
  
  - Those are very different conversations than this one on the rights of capitalist to exploit people. The kinds of conversations socialists have with eachother. Critiquing the present and dreaming of the future, instead of *conserving* the past.

- Though, if it seems that the question of the right to exploit workers is still a hot ticket that must be discussed, lets get into that too.
  
  - First and foremost, lets ask a question. What risk is it exactly that the capitalist is taking? Well that's simple. Firstly they made an investment so they stand to lose anything they invest, this of couse includes time and capital.
  
  - Depending on the precarity of the capitalists in question, losing their investment, i.e The business failing could mean losing their livelyhood, if theyre thrusted into destitution. As all members of the business class who aren't bourgeoisie proper, these smaller capitalists (the petty bourgeoisie) Are always in a state of either being absorbed into the ruling class, or being thrusted into this destitution. 
  
  - So, what is this destitution that lies at the end of failure for the capitalist? Well, in a word "Proletarianization" the threat held here against the capitalist is that they might lose their investments, leaving them with nothing, perhaps they took out a loan and now without success are forced to submit to the loaner or declare bankruptcy, this can result in being pushed under so far that they may never be able to save enough or take out another loan to be able to open a new business. They might have to work multiple jobs, and may have to live Paycheck to Paycheck.
  
  - The risk faced by the capitalist is the risk of joining the working class.
  
  - So this leads us to a second question, if the threat of joining the working class makes being a capitalist so risky. Then how could it be said that the workers aren't taking any risks for the business. 
  
  - Being a worker is inherently leagues more risky than being a capitalist. Society is setup in favor of business over workers. It has more institutions and protections, legal and more. All those protections and institutions which are conceded too the workers have been won through hard and violent struggles between the working class Proletariat and the Ruling Class bourgeoisie and their Petty bourgeoisie lackies.
  
  - Under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, a liberal democracy (democracy for the rich) Rule by the business class. Etc.. It is a simple obvious truth that the capitalist take less risks in business than their employees, as even in this particular case of starting maintaining and running the business, As the workers are the ones who stand to lose their jobs if it goes under, forcing them immediately back into working-class destitution where the capitalist may still have saving graces. Let alone the risk taken by doing the actual work.
  
  - The gravest risk faced by proletarians is imprisonment, enslavement, starvation, and suffering. Risks which they're scarcely rewarded for. The gravest risk faced by capitalists is proletarianization.
