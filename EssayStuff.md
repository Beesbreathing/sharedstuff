### Does the risk taken by the capitalist give them the right to exploit workers surplus value?

- *"The capitalist deserves to exploit surplus value since they bear the risk of opening, maintaining, and improving the business. They bear the cost of starting it and keeping it open. They bear the responsibility for whether the firm fails or succeeds, the workers dont. The value created by the workplace may be created from workers labour, but it is the workplace the capitalist is responsible for which was required to make the surplus value that the capitalist exploits as remuneration for this responsibility." or "the capitalist made an investment and this is how they should get their return."*
  
  - As in, Society ought to pay capitalists via allowing the exploitation of their workers surplus value, In exchange for taking a risk and operating a business. 

- That is the usual Pro-Exploitation argument. Now, the first response a socialist would probably give here is that it's a moot point, Gambling shouldnt be a fundamental part of the economy. 
  
  - If you could have a planned economy, with a proactive enough planning institution or computer system, then you'd have a means of absorbing all risks in the economy, with the economy as a whole, instead of dividing them amongst the capitalists. Such a thing would mitigate the risk and instability said to be brunted here by the capitalists.
  
  - Then the question would be, in simplistic words "how many firms will fail, and in what ways should we prepare to respond to such failures." Which is a much easier question to answer for a planning institution, than the question capitalists must answer "will my firm fail, which firms relavent to me will fail, and what can I do to prevent it." As that question simply has far more things to worry about. 
  
  - Planned economies mitigate risk, instead of rewarding it. The risk-managing jobs capitalists fulfill are not desired to exist.
  
  - The real conversation to be having is about things like whether planned economies would need to engage in exploitation before full automation was reached, whether non-aggregate markets can be planned effectively or not, what the road to the abolition of exploitation really looks like, Etc.. As in the efficacies, shortcomings, specifics, and historical examples of planned economies. 
  
  - Those are very different conversations than this one on the rights of capitalist to exploit people. The kinds of conversations socialists have with eachother. Critiquing the present and dreaming of the future, instead of *conserving* the past.

- Though, if it seems that the question of the right to exploit workers is still a hot ticket that must be discussed, lets get into that too.
  
  - First and foremost, lets ask a question. What risk is it exactly that the capitalist is taking? Well that's simple. Firstly they made an investment so they stand to lose anything they invest, this of couse includes time and capital.
  
  - Depending on the precarity of the capitalists in question, losing their investment, i.e The business failing could mean losing their livelyhood, if theyre thrusted into destitution. As all members of the business class who aren't bourgeoisie proper, these smaller capitalists (the petty bourgeoisie) Are always in a state of either being absorbed into the ruling class, or being thrusted into this destitution. 
  
  - So, what is this destitution that lies at the end of failure for the capitalist? Well, in a word "Proletarianization" the threat held here against the capitalist is that they might lose their investments, leaving them with nothing, perhaps they took out a loan and now without success are forced to submit to the loaner or declare bankruptcy, this can result in being pushed under so far that they may never be able to save enough or take out another loan to be able to open a new business. They might have to work multiple jobs, and may have to live Paycheck to Paycheck.
  
  - The risk faced by the capitalist is the risk of joining the working class.
  
  - So this leads us to a second question, if the threat of joining the working class makes being a capitalist so risky. Then how could it be said that the workers aren't taking any risks for the business. 
  
  - Being a worker is inherently leagues more risky than being a capitalist. Society is setup in favor of business over workers. It has more institutions and protections, legal and more. Any  protections or institutions which are conceded to the workers have been won through hard and violent struggles between the working class Proletariat and the Ruling Class bourgeoisie and their Petty bourgeoisie lackies.
  
  - Under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, under Liberal Democracies. Under these Democracies for the rich, which are Ruled by the business class. 
It is a simple obvious truth that the capitalist take less risks in 
business than their employees, As the workers are the ones who stand to 
lose their jobs if it goes under, potentially forcing masses of them immediately back into 
working-class destitution in the same situation where the capitalist may still have saving 
graces from the capitalist state institutions and laws, as in bailouts/limited liability etc... 

  - All this without mentioning the risk taken by doing the actual work or
 working in an unsafe or unhealthy environment.
  
  - The common gravest risk faced by the proletariat is physical or mental ailment or injury, imprisonment, enslavement, starvation, and suffering. Risks which they're scarcely rewarded for. The common gravest risk faced by capitalists is proletarianization.
